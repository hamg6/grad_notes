Fundamentals of probability, random processes, statistics, and decision analysis are covered, along with random variables and vectors, uncertainty propagation, conditional distributions, and second-moment analysis. System reliability is introduced. Other topics covered include Bayesian analysis and risk-based decision, estimation of distribution parameters, hypothesis testing, simple and multiple linear regressions, and Poisson and Markov processes. There is an emphasis placed on real-world applications to engineering problems.\n",
